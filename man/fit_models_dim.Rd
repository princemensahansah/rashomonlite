\title{Fit multiple logistic regression models of a specified dimension}
\usage{
fit_models_dim(X, y, k, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A data frame or matrix of predictors. Columns should be numeric or
factors suitable for inclusion in a logistic regression.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of binary responses (0 = failure, 1 = success),
with length equal to the number of rows in \code{X}.}

\item{k}{Integer specifying the number of predictors to include in each model.}

\item{m}{Integer specifying the maximum number of models to fit for this dimension.
If the total number of possible combinations exceeds \code{m}, a random sample of
size \code{m} is drawn (with fixed seed for reproducibility).}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per fitted model and the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{vars}{Character vector of predictor names included in the model.}
  \item{aic}{Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value for the model.}
  \item{coef}{Named numeric vector of model coefficients.}
  \item{pvals}{Named numeric vector of p-values for each coefficient.}
}
}
\description{
This function fits all (or a sampled subset) of generalized linear models (GLMs)
of a given dimension \code{k} from the predictors in \code{X}. It computes model AIC,
regression coefficients, and p-values for each model.
